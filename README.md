## Outline of Project
- **Selected Topic:** Stroke
- **Reason for Selected topic:** The topic was selected due to interest in examining potential risk factors that may cause strokes, the second leading cause of death worldwide, and a major cause of severe disability.
- **Source of data:** The dataset was sourced from Kaggle. This dataset contains 43,400 observations with 11 attributes. Each row in the data provides relevant patient information. The initial source of the data is unknown.
  - train_strokes.csv: contains data specific to patients (age, gender, heart disease, hypertension, etc.)
- ** Questions I hope to answer with the data:**
  - What are the significant risk factors for a stroke?
  - Can machine learning predict whether a patient is likely to suffer a stroke based on one's demographics (age, gender, marital status, type of work and residence) and health records (presence of hypertension and/or heart disease, average glucose level measured after a meal, Body Mass Index (BMI), smoking status, and experience of stroke)?
